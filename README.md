# coin_toss_and_dice_throw
C++ 



Here, I created a small game which is about coin toss and dice thrown. 
1. Prompt a message inviting the user to insert his/her student number;
2. The student number must have at least 2 digits but not more than 8 digits. If this condition is not respected the program must be aborted.
3. Calculates the reminder of dividing the student number by 3.
4. At that point:
  A. If the reminder is equal to 0 the program must simulate the process of tossing a coin;
  B. If the reminder is equal to 1 the program must simulate the process of tossing one dice;
  C. If the reminder is equal to 2 the program must simulate the process of tossing two dices.
5. The process selected at step 4 must be simulated N times as follow:
  A. Split the student number into two equal size parts*
  B. Multiply point-by-point and sum.
  C. Calculate the reminder of dividing the result by 50 and add 20. D. The result will represent the number of tosses or throws.
6. The results of tosses or throws must be saved into an appropriate array. In particular a one-dimensional array in the cases of coin toss or single dice toss, or bi-dimensional array in the case of two dices toss.
7. Print the elements stored in the array.
